Node Fsharp Script Runner allows you to resolve scripts on demand based on a tree walking algorithm.

To execute a command, type:
>nfsr %yourcommand% %params-if-applicable%

nfsr will attempt to walk the tree from your current path recursively into any nested folders looking for scripts.
The first script matching the name will be executed. If this fails, it will begin searching node_modules for scripts. 
The closest to your current path wins.

You can also target specific scripts:
-
Options available are
-f Fsharp
-b Batch files
-p Powershell ps1 scripts
-s Shell scripts

To resolve a batch file for example
>nfsr -b my-batch-file

you may also list files:
>nfsr list -b -f

or see the full path of the resolved target script which is executed by nfsr:
>nfsr resolve %yourBatch% -b
