Allows creation and management of dynamic references to libraries using the same resolution strategy as for scripts.

Options are as follows:
dynamic-refs
	add <library>			Adds the library to the lock file and refreshes
	remove <library>		Removes the library from the lock file and refreshes
	refresh					Refreshes the refs^.fsx  file from the .lock file
	clean					Removes both refs and lock files
	
A _DynamicReferences.lock will be created to store these reference. This may be checked in to source control.
_DynamicReferences.fsx should be .gitignored or excluded from source control.
