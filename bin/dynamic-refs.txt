Allows creation and management of dynamic references to libraries using the same resolution strategy as for scripts.

Options are as follows:
dynamic-refs
	add <library>
	remove <library>
	refresh
	
A _DynamicReferences.txt will be created to store these reference. This may be checked in to source control.
_DynamicReferences.fsx should be .gitignored or excluded from source control.
